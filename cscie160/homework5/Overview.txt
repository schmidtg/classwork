Description:
This program implements the Automated Teller Machine (ATM) using Java's Remote Method Invocation (RMI). It supports a variety of accounts as well as some basic operations including deposit, withdraw and get a balance. The ATM is run in its own process and handles remote requests from a client running in another process.

Assumptions
- The server receives requests on port 1099
- RMI is configured and an RMISecurityManager can run in the JVM
- a general security policy is used to grant permissions to the client accessing the remote object
- I had to hard-code the filepath for my java.rmi.server.codebase to my home directoy on my computer, please change this accordingly to your environment

Execution
1. Run 'ant' in the base directory which will compile the java classes, build the jars and create the associated javadoc files. Unfortunately I had a small issue with the ordering of the the -classpath variable when invoking my jar from ant. I wanted ant to write the command as the following:

java -Djava.rmi.server.codebase=file:/Users/grahamschmidt/Java/homework5/build/jar/hw5Server.jar -Djava.security.policy=lib/security.policy -classpath /Users/grahamschmidt/Java/homework5/build/jar/hw5Server.jar cscie160.hw5.Server

Where my main-class was the last argument on the command line and my security policy was at the beginning. When I invoked the above command from my 'build' directory I was able to start my server. However, ant would invoke my runServer jar in the following order:

java -classpath /Users/grahamschmidt/Java/homework5/build/jar/hw5Server.jar cscie160.hw5.Server -Djava.rmi.server.codebase=file:/Users/grahamschmidt/Java/homework5/build/jar/hw5Server.jar -Djava.security.policy=lib/security.policy

This seemed to cause an exception. So eventually I abandoned trying to invoke and run everything from ant.

2. The rmiregistry should've been invoked after running ant. To start the server, since the ant build was incomplete, type:
java -Djava.rmi.server.codebase=file:/Users/grahamschmidt/Java/homework5/build/jar/hw5Server.jar -Djava.security.policy=lib/security.policy -classpath /Users/grahamschmidt/Java/homework5/build/jar/hw5Server.jar cscie160.hw5.Server
(where you substitute the directory for the java.rmi.codebase file:/... to the directory appropriate on your computer)

3. Run the client.
java -Djava.rmi.server.codebase=file:/Users/grahamschmidt/Java/homework5/build/jar/hw5Server.jar -Djava.security.policy=lib/security.policy -classpath build/jar/hw5Client.jar cscie160.hw5.Client


Alternate Execution
1. After running ant, navigate to build/classes
2. Run rmiregistry
>> rmiregistry -J-cp -J. &
3. Run the Server.
>> java -Djava.security.policy=security.policy -cp . cscie160.hw5.Server
4. In another terminal, run the Client from the build/classes directory.
>> java -Djava.security.policy=security.policy -cp . cscie160.hw5.Client
