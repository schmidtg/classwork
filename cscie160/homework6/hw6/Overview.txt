Description:
The homework implements threading in our ATM client/server program. The Server creates 5 threads on startup, passes each thread a reference to a collection that contains worker-objects filled with commands to execute that were sent from the client to the server. Through the effective use of wait/notify, we implement a simple Thread pool that allows us to use multiple threads to process work from a client.

Assumptions
- there is only one Account object
- the Client code that deposits/withdraws amounts is already provided

Execution
1. Extract the hw4server.jar
2. Extract the hw4client.jar
3. In the hw4server directory, type 'ant' (the server should be started on port 7777)
4. In the hw4client directory, type 'ant'

Known Problems
Somehow the Server does not always return to the command prompt and you must type CTNL-C to stop it running.
