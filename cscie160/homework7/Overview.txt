Description:
The final homework project had us create multiple server objects (ATMServer, Bank and Security) that were registered with the RMI registry. We then connected a client to an ATM which made remote calls to the server objects in order to process transactions on the account.

The client prints out event handlers after each transaction that notify the user an action was performed.

Assumptions
- there were 3 Accounts created in the Bank implementation
- I registered all server objects on port 1099
- the Client code that deposits/withdraws amounts is already provided

Execution
1. After extracting the jar, navigate to the classes folder.
2. Type 'rmiregsistry &' in the terminal window.
3. In that same terminal window, start up the ATM server by typing:
java cscie160.project.ATMServer
4. In another terminal, start up the BankServer
java cscie160.project.BankServer
5. In another terminal, run the client.
java cscie160.project.Client


Known Problems
You must type CTNL-C to stop all three processes from running.
